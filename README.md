|Project|Description|Key words|Libraries|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1. [Churn Prediction for Telecom Company](https://github.com/A-Yordanova/portfolio/tree/main/1.%20Churn%20Prediction%20for%20Telecom%20Company)|The project involves solving a classification problem to predict whether a customer will terminate their contract. The company provided depersonalized data about customers and their contracts, gathered from four different sources.|`gradient_boosting` `kNN` `pipeline`|`pandas` `sklearn` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `phik` `skimpy` `lightgbm` `catboost`|
|2. Age Prediction from Photos|The project involves solving a regression problem to predict customer age from photos to ensure complience with alcohol sale regulations and to personalize product offerings in a supermarket chain.|`computer_vision` <br> `neural_network` <br> `ResNet50` `imagenet`|`pandas` `tensorflow.keras`|
|3. [Comments Classification](https://github.com/A-Yordanova/portfolio/tree/main/3.%20Comments%20Classification)|In this project, we are classifying comments on an online shop's website to automate the identification of toxic comments for further moderation to improve user experience.|`natural_language_processing` <br> `BERT` `gradient_boosting`|`pandas` `numpy` `sklearn` `torch` `transformers` `nltk` `xgboost`|
|4. [Employee Satisfaction and Outflow Prediction](https://github.com/A-Yordanova/portfolio/tree/main/4.%20Employee%20Satisfaction%20and%20Outflow%20Prediction)|In this project, we solve a regression problem to predict employee satisfaction rates and a classification problem to predict whether an employee will leave the company soon. Additionally, we create a profile of employees likely to leave.| `kNN` `DecisionTree` `SVM` <br> `linear_regression` <br> `logistic_regression` <br> `statistical_test` <br> `KBest` `pipeline` |`pandas` `numpy` `phik` `statmodels` `scipy` `sklearn` `matplotlib` `seaborn`|
|5. [Determining optimal oil well location](https://github.com/A-Yordanova/portfolio/tree/main/5.%20Determining%20optimal%20oil%20well%20location)|In this project, we predict the amount of crude oil in wells across three regions in Russia. We utilize the Bootstrap technique to calculate potential profits and assess the risks of losses.|`linear_regression` <br> `bootstrap`|`pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `statmodels`|
|6. [Choosing Cows for Farming](https://github.com/A-Yordanova/portfolio/tree/main/6.%20Choosing%20Cows%20for%20Farming)|In this project, we help a farmer to select cows for purchase. To choose the best cows, we need to predict their milk yield and determine whether the milk will be tasty according to the farmer's methodology.|`linear_regression` <br> `logistic_regression`|`pandas` `numpy` `phik` `scipy` `sklearn` `seaborn` `matplotlib`|
